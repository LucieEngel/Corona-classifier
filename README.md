# Detect pnemonia from chest X-Rays

## Lucie Engel - CentraleSup√©lec 

The aim of this notebook is to develop a machine learning model to classify chest X-rays between healthy patients and patients with pnemonia. 

I am using the open source dataset "CoronaHack - Chest X-Ray" from kaggle that can be found here : https://www.kaggle.com/praveengovi/coronahack-chest-xraydataset
